Amanda Ernar has acquired many skills during her lifespan of less than twenty years. She has qualified for the Los Angeles Regional Spelling Bee when she was just in the fourth grade and has always thought of herself as an "excellent speller". Lately, Ernar has been working on a net-worth tracking application that would be handled by a single database. She has astounding grades, nice hair, and a beautiful piano. Oh, yeah, she can play piano. Forgot to write that. (pls don't fire me)
