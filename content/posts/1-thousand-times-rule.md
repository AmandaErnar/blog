Have you ever heard or read somewhere about the 1,000 times rule? Well, if you haven't, it's actually pretty simple to understand. Perhaps you've heard the saying, "If you could do _____ one thousand times in the future, how would you do it?" Let's say you're driving your car and running a bit late for your job interview. Suddenly, your phone starts buzzing like crazy and plays a song by Mariah Carey: your interviewer is calling you. You have two options at this point. The first one is to take the call and increase your chances of crashing your car, and the second option is for you to ignore your ringing phone. There's really no wrong answer here, though. Just ask yourself this: "If you were hastily driving to work one thousand times and someone was calling you, would you take the call?" (The probability of getting into a car accident is 1/103 drives, btw)

Another thing to consider when asking yourself the 1,000 rule question is that when you start something for the first time, you are more likely to do it again in the future. If you drink alcohol for the first time ever, you're more likely to drink more alcohol in the future. The same thing applies for eating chocolate before a meal, writing on a piece of paper instead of your $1,200 iPad, and even reading a book with or without a light on. Which outcome would you prefer?
