Actions speak louder than words. You can say something, but your actions have to back you up. If your actions *don't* back you up, well then you're lying.

You can bore your neighbors about how good you are at chess, but when a fifteen year-old beats you, they won't believe you anymore. I can already hear someone shoutng "B-but they were a child prodigy!" in the corner over there.

You have to act.
