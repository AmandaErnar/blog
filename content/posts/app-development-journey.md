React Native is an extremely useful app framework that is used by major companies such as Instagram, Facebook, and even Discord. “Oh, but Amanda, doesn’t Apple only support things created with X-Code and Swift?” You probably have no idea what you’re talking about. There are plenty of third-party app frameworks that work just as well as Xcode, but unfortunately Apple hates them (seriously).

As far as I know, there are two ways to make a React Native project. The first one is to just use plain react native cli, which can support really complex apps. The other option is to use expo, which is a quicker way to make your app but has a large file size and can’t do many things that plain react native can. It’s a lot quicker, though!

If you don’t already know, I’m in the middle of creating an iOS app, and I plan on using React Native. Should I use the regular React Native CLI, or should I use Expo?
