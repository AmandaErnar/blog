It's very human of us to make excuses for ourselves, but that doesn't mean that it's a good thing to do. Making excuses is disrespectful and it prevents your confronter from getting their point across. When confronted, the best thing you can do is just apologize and admit that you're wrong. If you truly believe that they are not correct in the issue they've addressed, politely state your opinion in a clear way for them to understand. Making excuses will not help solve your problem. Sometimes we know deep in our hearts that we are wrong but refuse to admit it to ourselves. This makes us puff out our chests and annoy everyone.

Just don't do it.

Also, don't procrastinate. Keep things you need to complete/get done somewhere that keeps you from forgetting them.

P.S. Heat Waves by Glass Animals is an absolute bop. Check it out!
