"From Woodsong" by Gary Paulsen tells a heartwarming story concerning the day he encounters a bear. The tale commences when Paulsen is removing burned food from his home one beautiful July morning. He spots a large male bear tearing his trash can apart. Paulsen then provokes the bear by hurling shoots and branches at it, and the animal charged. The bear's intimidating figure hovered above Paulsen for a good minute or two, sniffing him up and down. It then deliberately crept away from him, and as the bear proceeds to scour through the wastebin, a chilling question confronts Paulsen.

*He was still there, rummaging through the trash. I worked the bolt and fed a cartridge in and aimed at the place where you kill bears and began to squeeze. In raw anger, I began to take up the four pounds of pull necessary to send death into him and stopped. Kill him for what? That thought crept in. Kill him for what? For not killing me? For letting me know it is wrong to through sticks at four-hundred pound bears? For not hurting me, for not killing me, I should kill him? I lowered the rifle and ejected the shell and put the gun away.*

In conclusion, one should learn to swallow their pride and learn to accept the way other things are instead of exerting force and anger upon them. Be rational. Does killing the bear achieve anything? Being alive will become much more pleasurable if one understands this concept. You may not know it, but "From Woodsong" teaches a lesson many do not know.
