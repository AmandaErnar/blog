It's been about a few months since the beginning of the national lockdown. So far, there have been 6,570,362 cases reported worldwide. There are about ten times that amount, so that would be 60 million cases. I'm kind of scared about going outside. 2020 has been a terrible year so far.

These are a few things that have happened since January first:

- The novel coronavirus of 2019 has spread to many countries
- World War 3 threatened to start
- Australia is burning (koalas are dying)
- A helicopter crash kills Kobe and Gianna Bryant
- COVID-19 is considered a pandemic
- Dow plunges almost 3,000 points
- Tokyo postpones Olympics
- The United States officially impeaches President Trump
- Officers brutally murder George Floyd, sparking uprisings in Minneapolis
- Black Lives Matter comes back due to black deaths
- Criminals loot homes, banks, and luxury stores
- Protesters burn down cities
- ALL TOILET PAPER IS GONE
- The only good things that have happened are
- Dolphins are in the Venice Canals due to no pollution
