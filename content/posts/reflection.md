Move fast. If you can move *quicker*, then do it, especially if you have priorities.
Be efficient. Learn in an efficient manner. Use your brian; if something isn't worth doing, then don't do it.
Plan. Have an aim/goal for the day. Whether you're hanging out with your friends, coding, doing martial arts, try to always have a goal. Planning is the only way you're going to get anywhere in life.
Think of a strategy and don't blindly do things. You look ahead when you walk, don't you? You don't close your eyes when you walk. See what's in front of you. Again, if something's not work doing, then don't do it.
Have a target! If you aim, you don't shoot. Don't shoot, never hit the target. What do I want in life? What is my ultimate goal? I will change. I *will* and *must* have a goal in life.
Don't be timid. Have good posture and be social, because people who don't do those things will not survive in the real world.Talk actively, make decisions, always be the leading/dominant voice. In other words, get on top of all your shit and **speak up**. It's always advisable to have the upper hand in conversations. Especially if they're talking about you.
I am currently wasting time. If things don't get better quick, I will be destined to fail.

Oh, and one last thing:
Learn from your mistakes.

Don't be soft. It's better to be aggressive than soft. If you aim farther, you will for sure reach yur goal. This means I have to 100% be louder and more social. Be more active, have more energy. *Keep trying and don't give up.* Even if it means breaking things, never, ever make up excuses that will stop you from reaching your goal. Choose to keep walking through the dangerous and hard path ahead of you rather than turn back. Ask new people to roll at jiu-jitsu; make more friends; ask your friends to meet up in person; move faster.
