I remember falling asleep that night and never waking up, opening my eyes to a ceaseless, nightmarish horror unraveling itself before me as I stood.

"Mother."

My mother rocked back and forth as if she were a feeble procelain doll. Virtuous drops of blood, a triumphant and noble shade of crimson, trickled down her mouth and trailed along her slender sihlouette as she swayed. Her bloodcurling smile sent shockwaves down my spine.
I watched with terror as my mother's eyes fluttered shut and she buckled at the knees. Dead before her torso met the floor.

That was the morning my mother died a woeful death, leaving me a helpless orphan.
The doctors told me it was Tuberculosis, although I don't recall her coughing before she'd fallen. I knew they were lying. Behind their pretentious smiles hid their inscrutable fear; no one knew just what had been the cause of my mother's tragic demise.

When I attended my mother's funeral dressed in airy tufts of black lace and uncomfortable fabric, I wondered what I had done to deserve this. Was my mother's death the doing of God? Was this His fault?
No. I attended church and didn't mingle with heathens. I dressed modestly and prayed before every meal. This couldn't be the doing of our benevolent father.

Years since then, I had grown up with my mother's maidens, faced with the task of running our beloved city-state and managing local affairs.
