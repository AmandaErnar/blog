*Alison's POV*

My name is Alison Wheatley. I live in a city called Renee in a country called Faust. My life is ordinary.
Those statements were true statements about myself, just as my teacher wanted us to include in our introductional presentation.

The presentation was about ourselves and how we loved our beloved nation; to introduce ourselves to the class with virtue.
Though if I were to be completely honest, I *despised* our country. Faust (especially Renee) was plagued with violence and corruption. Children were caned in the streets and most families couldn't even afford clean water to drink, while noblemen reaped the hearty benefits of being born in the upper class. The fact that I had to write about our *beloved nation* was almost laughable.

I looked around the classroom and tried to spot someone else who detested the assignment as much as I did, but everyone else seemed to be quite interested in what they were doing. I put my pencil down with a loud thump and rolled my eyes. This class made me want to steal a dead person's social security number and settle in some town that wasn't Renee.

*still Alison btw*

I looked up at the crimson sky above me, inhaling the bitter scent of ash and rubble. There was something enchanting about the raw blood-red sky, dappled with brilliant stars and swirling clouds of yellow. I felt safe, surrounded by parents and children weeping as they fled our burning city. Black and ashen smoke hazed up and out of the buildings around me, with flames blossoming frenzily and eventually swallowing the town whole. I felt warm. Then, suddenly, I closed my eyes and fell sound asleep... or so, I thought.

I awoke in 

**something happens here**
*Iris's POV*

I remember falling asleep that night and never waking up, opening my eyes to a ceaseless, nightmarish horror unraveling itself before me as I stood.

"Mother."

My mother didn't say a word as sheer drops of blood, a noble shade of crimson, trickled down her mouth and trailed handsomely down her sihlouette. I watched with terror as my mother's eyes fluttered shut and she buckled at the knees. Dead before her torso met the floor.

That was the morning my mother died a woeful death, leaving me an orphan, vulnerable to the obscene world around me.

The doctors told me my mother had caught Tuberculosis, although I don't recall her coughing before that dreadful day.
They were obviously lying. I didn't blame them, however, because how exactly could you explain to a three year-old child that their mother had just been murdered? I'm sure they noticed the deep wound in her back. Of course I was old enough.
Behind their pretentious smiles hid their inscrutable fear.

When I attended my mother's funeral dressed in airy tufts of black lace and uncomfortable fabric, I wondered what I had done to deserve this. Was my mother's death the doing of God? Was this His fault?
No. I attended church and didn't mingle with heathens. I dressed modestly and prayed before every meal. This couldn't be the doing of our benevolent father.

Years since then, I had grown up with my mother's maidens, faced with the task of running our beloved city-state and managing local affairs.

**something really long and detailed happens here**
*?'s POV*

The Iris I knew was gone. All that remained of her was an empty husk of a human, bewitched by Lilith into thinking she had to kill every other human she laid her eyes upon. I thought of those
"You really shouldn't hate that insufferable little girl," I heard a divine voice croon from behind me.
