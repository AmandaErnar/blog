I loved the sea. I grew up in a yacht sailing gallantly on the calm waters of the Atlantic ocean. But sometimes, the water wasn't too tranquil and could swallow a boat whole. I only ate fish for years on end, helped sweep the decks, and raised the sails on our family yacht.

"Momma! Can me and Charlie swim today?" I asked, bouncing up and down as my mom did the dishes. She laughed. "Only when we get to calmer waters," Mom told us, bending down. "Is that okay, Hannah?" I nodded, a wee bit disappointed that I had to wait longer. I raced to Charlie and I's bedroom to tell him the news. I remember us sobbing into our pillows because we had to swim later in the day.

I learned to read and do math quickly, for my mother was a teacher in her younger years. I eventually was able to read college-level books and solve complex math problems by the age of fourteen. Charlie, however, could hardly read at all. My mom spent years teaching him, but it was of no help. We'd never really been on land before, besides having to buy groceries, toiletries, and apparel from small shops along the Italian coast. It was a challenge to buy necessities because we knew only English.

"Hannah! Pass me the rope!" I heard Charlie call from behind me. He was working on repairs. "Coming," I hollered, pulling from a tangled coil of rope. I tossed him some of the cables and got back to tightening the screws around the corner. Just a few more twists and--

"The internet connection is too slow!" Mom cried, trying to work on her computer. "I'll fix it!" I loved tinkering with small gadgets, and whenever someone needed help on anything involving precise handiwork, I was the one to call. After I tightened a bolt with my screwdriver, I hurried over to my mother and fixed her issue. The problem was simple; she was too far away from the modem.

"Charlie! Can you stitch the sail?" I yelled. I was busy and preparing for dinner. Besides, tonight's sunset was gorgeous, and I wanted to stay somewhere with a pleasant view.
