They say trust is like an eraser because it gets smaller every time you use it up. I agree. Trust gives individuals power, and it's more valuable than gold. But by "using" trust, what do they mean? Well, lying. If you didn't assume that then you're dumb lol

It's hard to trust people with a history of lying. You all know the tale of the boy who cried wolf. Aesop, am I right? It's the tale of a boy who always lied about wolves coming to attack his village. The other villagers despised him for it. When wolves actually came to attack the poor town, the boy tried to warn them, but they all assumed he was lying. The boy then got eaten by a wolf.

What comes around goes around.
