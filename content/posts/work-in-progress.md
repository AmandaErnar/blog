I gazed upon the verdant hillcrest stitching itself into the Tanando Mountain's base. The obscure cavities tracing the outline of the range zig-zagged and spiraled gracefully before combining with the noble coastline by the east. The setting sun shone its last bits of light onto our fine city-state, Tanando Landing.
"April, your father wants to have a word with you," my butler, Mr. Bauer, announced as he coughed violently into his elbow. He hadn't taken his medicine today, had he? I cleared my throat politely. "I'll be there in a jiffy," I responded. The truth was, I had no desire to speak with my father. He had suggested I marry a certain aristocrat's son. I hadn't even met the guy yet!
Frustrated, I stomped over to my father's study, where he would be patiently waiting for me to arrive.

"April."

My face whitened as soon as I saw him. I nervously fiddled with the zipper on my jacket, avoiding his menacing glare. "Look. I don't want to make your life any worse," he told me, lacing his fingers together. Sighing, he reached for his box of cigars and smiled coldly. Seriously?
"I honestly don't want him going anywhere near my daughter. How about we just murder him instead?" He chuckled, fits of smoke coming out of his mouth. I squinted. There was no way he wasn't joking. "Murder?" I laughed. He pursed his lips together and shrugged. "We could burn the carcass. Perhaps we could poison his drink, follow him into his room, stab the life out of the guy, and toss his body into the river. We could also splash some bleach over 'em and toss a blazing match onto it, if you'd prefer."
I swallowed, unsure whether he was joking or not.
"It's easier than it seems. All you gotta do is red tornado and yellow tractor."

I halted. "I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?"
"Red tornado and yellow tractor," he repeated, a self-righteous and calm look on his face.

No, it couldn't be...

"Does it all come back to you now, April?" He asked, bringing more smoke into the cramped room. "I-" I started, shaking my head. No! Anyone but my father. "Does it all make sense?" He asked again, tapping his head as if ridiculing me. Before he could say another word, I instinctively grabbed him by the collar and punched him across his smug little face.
"YOU. FUCKING. SWINE," I shouted, my voice quivering. This man was scum!

Father smirked. "There's nothing you can do about it," he laughed. "Your friend is gone now. Tell anyone, and they'll hang you as well."
