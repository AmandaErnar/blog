I gazed upon the verdant hillcrest stitching itself into the Tanando Mountain's base. The obscure cavities tracing the outline of the range zig-zagged and spiraled gracefully before combining with the noble coastline by the east. The setting sun shone its last bits of light onto our fine city-state, Tanando Landing.
"April, your father wants to have a word with you," my butler, Mr. Bauer, announced as he coughed violently into his elbow. He hadn't taken his medicine today, had he? I cleared my throat politely. "I'll be there in a jiffy," I responded. The truth was, I had no desire to speak with my father. He had suggested I marry a certain aristocrat's son. I hadn't even met the guy yet!
Frustrated, I stomped over to my father's study, where he would be submissively waiting for me to arrive. The room was spacious and had towering bookshelves overlaying its vintage walls. A prominent chair with a velvet seat settled at one corner of the room, and a massive wooden clock in the other. The floors were made from marble, and a spectacular gold chandelier hovered right above my tall father's head. In front of him lay a polished table made from Cedar. On top of it, a green lamp, a tin box of cigars, and a heap of unread mail sit serenely.

"April."

My face whitened as soon as I saw him. He was a weird man, to say the very least. He had long, gray hair and villainous green eyes. He wore a pinstripe suit with the chain of a gold compass dangling from its pocket. His skin, yet wrinkled, had a solemn and insubordinate quality. He sat by his desk with a hazing cigar in his hand and a vicious glare.
I nervously fiddled with the zipper on my jacket, avoiding his gaze. "Look. I don't want to make your life any worse," he told me, lacing his fingers together. Sighing, he reached for another cigar and smiled coldly. Seriously?
"I honestly don't want him going anywhere near my daughter," he explained, fits of smoke coming out of his mouth, "how about we just murder him instead?" See, here's the thing with my father: you could never tell if he was joking or not. I gazed at him quizzically. "Murder?" I laughed. He pursed his lips together and shrugged. "We could burn the carcass. Perhaps we could poison his drink, follow him into his room, stab the life out of the guy, and toss his body into the river. We could also splash some bleach over 'em and toss a blazing match onto it, if you'd prefer."
I swallowed. "Are you serious?"
"It's easier than it seems. All you gotta do is red tornado and yellow tractor."

I halted. I stopped nervously swaying from side to side, and I felt my entire body freeze. I could hear my heart beating faster and faster. "I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?"
"Red tornado and yellow tractor," he repeated, a self-righteous and calm look on his face.

No, it couldn't be...

"Does it all come back to you now, April?" He asked, bringing more smoke into the smoggy room. "I-" I started, shaking my head. No! Anyone but my own, biological father. "Does it all make sense?" He asked again, tapping his head as if ridiculing me. Before he could say another word, I instinctively grabbed him by his stupid pinstripe and punched him across his smug little face.
"YOU. FUCKING. SWINE," I shouted, my voice quivering.

Father smirked. "There's nothing you can do about it," he laughed. "Your friend is gone now. Tell anyone, and they'll hang you as well."
