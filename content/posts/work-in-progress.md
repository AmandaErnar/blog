Creative Writing Prompt: Murder Mystery

I gazed upon the verdant hillcrest stitching itself into the Tanando Mountain's base. The obscure cavities tracing the outline of the range zig-zagged and spiraled gracefully before combining with the noble coastline by the east. The setting sun shone its last bits of light onto our fine city-state, Tanando Landing.
"April, your father wants to have a word with you," my butler, Mr. Bauer, announced as he coughed violently into his elbow. He hadn't taken his medicine today, had he? I cleared my throat politely. "I'll be there in a jiffy," I responded. The truth was, I had no desire to speak with my father. At dinner, he suggested that I marry the son of a certain aristocrat (W.J. Tolley) that I hated with the bottom of my heart, just for a nobler position in society. Like, I hadn’t even met the guy! I had every right to be upset.
Frustrated, I stomped over to my father's study, where he was waiting patiently for me to arrive. The room was spacious and had towering bookshelves overlaying its vintage walls. A prominent chair with a plump, velvet seat settled at one corner of the room, and a grandfather clock in the other. A spectacular gold chandelier hovered elegantly from the room’s astute canopy. In front of my father, a polished table with a green lamp, two tin boxes of cigars, and a heap of unread mail sit serenely.

"April."

My face whitened as soon as I heard my name. My father had long, gray hair and villainous green eyes. He wore a pinstripe suit with the chain of a gold compass dangling from its pocket. His skin, yet wrinkled, had a solemn and insubordinate quality. He sat by his desk with a hazing cigar placed delicately in between his long, bony fingers.
I nervously fiddled with the zipper on my jacket. "Look. Your life is already a mess," he told me, lacing his fingers together. Sighing, he stamped his cigar out on the back of his palm and pursed his lips together.
"I honestly don't want him going anywhere near my daughter," he explained, fits of smoke coming out of his mouth. "He’s a bit of a disgrace to the Tanando aristocracy. Doesn’t even know how to fold his own laundry. A little porkchop, I daresay of that Richard Tolley. And he’s just not right for you! According to his older brother, he spends all day eating pastries baked fresh from the kitchen and sleeping around-- even on Sundays! Oh, did I mention the fact that he isn’t even religious? I could go on and on about how fat little Richard Tolley wouldn’t be a good partner for you. Definitely not that Barley boy, either, so don’t get any ideas. So, April, how about we simply just murder him instead?" He finished.
See, here's the thing with my father: you could never tell if he was joking or not.
I gazed at him quizzically. "Murder?" I laughed.
He shrugged. "Perhaps we could also toss his body into the Tanando river."

I swallowed. "Are you serious?"
"It's easier than it seems. All you gotta do is red tornado and yellow tractor."

I froze. "I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?"
"Red tornado and yellow tractor," he repeated, a self-righteous and calm look on his face.

No, it couldn't be...

"Does it all come back to you now, April?" He asked, bringing more smoke into the smoggy room. "I-" I started, shaking my head. "Does it all make sense?" He asked again, tapping his head as if ridiculing me. Before he could say another word, I instinctively grabbed him by his stupid pinstripe collar and punched him across his smug little face.

"YOU SWINE," I shouted, my voice quivering.

Father smirked. "There's nothing you can do about it," he laughed. "Your friend is gone now. Tell anyone, and they'll hang you as well."

_________

Fletcher Barley. He was your typical teenage chap that was around six feet in height with brown, side-swept hair. He wasn't poor, nor rich, and happened to be my best friend. No matter where he was, you could always find him alongside Sunny the German Shepherd.
It didn't hit me with surprise when I found Sunny being chased by a cheerful Fletcher one pleasant afternoon.

Sunny barked enthusiastically at the sight of me. "Hey, Sunny," I grinned as I bent down to pet the energetic ball of fluffiness. Sunny wagged her muddy tail, dropping dirt on Fletcher's khakis. "Sunny!" He frowned, dusting himself off.

"How's your sister, Fletcher?" I asked him, Sunny cheerily trotting around me. He shrugged. "She's taking care of my mom at the moment," he sighed. "The doctors in town don't know what's happened to her. They've never seen anything like this before." All of a sudden, both of us didn't feel as happy as before. Even Sunny stopped wagging her tail and whimpered sadly. "I may need to pay her a visit soon, then. Do you have errands? Could I help you with anything at all?" I asked a crestfallen Fletcher, who smiled sadly and shook his head. "It's Sunday. We both ought to go to Church," he chuckled. He was trying to change the subject; I didn't blame him.

I fumbled with my lace collar. "Right. We'll have to get cleaned up, especially Sunny," I muttered.

Small children roamed the streets of North Tanando, stealing colorful scarves right off the mannequins inside various shops and seizing apples right from stocked grocery shelves. I couldn't help but remember the time when Fletcher would do the same thing. One time he even snuck inside my family's mansion to steal pet food for Sunny. "What a joyous lifestyle," I muttered, my cloth shoes squeezing the tips of my feet. Okay, okay. It's not like my life was any better.

"Maybe your father can let us ride Tanando's dragons one day," Fletcher smiled. "They're the last of their kind. I call dibs on the Diamondback!"

"Yellow Jays are way cooler," I scoffed, gazing up at the winged creatures soaring miles above our heads. It was as if they were fantastical illusions that could disappear in an instant. If you thought about it, there was no way such a thing could survive in today's world. "Hey, you sure those are real and aren't some sort of government propaganda?" I asked quietly. Fletcher snickered. "You're starting to sound like those hippies who still believe the earth is flat," he laughed, making my face go red. You know, maybe I wasn't so smart after all.

The Town Church was large, to say the very least. It had wondrous bouquets of eye-catching flowers displayed in every corner of the structure and a beautiful mural painted over an entire wall. The ceiling was made from glass and extended from one side to the other. Countless rows of wooden seats filled the spacious church, giving a sense of togetherness and well-being.

“Looks like we came early,” I whispered, staring at the empty seats in front of us. Fletcher smiled weakly. “Go, Sunny,” he pointed towards the door and smiled. Sunny then exited the church and left Fletcher and I alone. “How’s your father,” he asked, folding his arms and taking a seat. I made a face. “He’s so boring. I wish I had a new father. He’s so… ah. I hate him. I really do,” I scoffed, playing with the cuffs of my jeans. “I just wanna skip stones and paint all day long, but he won’t let me. I have to go to parties and stuff where I usually leave the table and just play with the six-year-olds who often get pencils stuck up their noses.” I shuddered, clearly having post-wartime flashbacks. Fletcher nodded and smiled. “I can totally get what you’re trying to say. Gosh, that must be awful,” he laughed heartily. Yeah. Life was hard.

We prayed, said our goodbyes, and walked on home. Fletcher Barley was a nice person.
