Fletcher Barley. He was your typical teenage chap that was around six feet in height with brown, side-swept hair. He wasn't poor, nor rich, and happened to be my best friend. No matter where he was, you could always find him alongside Sunny the German Shepherd.
It didn't hit me with surprise when I found Sunny being chased by a cheerful Fletcher one pleasant afternoon.

Sunny barked enthusiastically at the sight of me. "Hey, Sunny," I grinned as I bent down to pet the energetic ball of fluffiness. Sunny wagged her muddy tail, dropping dirt on Fletcher's khakis. "Sunny!" He frowned, dusting himself off.

"How's your sister, Fletcher?" I asked him, Sunny cheerily trotting around me. He shrugged. "She's taking care of my mom at the moment," he sighed. "The doctors in town don't know what's happened to her. They've never seen anything like this before." All of a sudden, both of us didn't feel as happy as before. Even Sunny stopped wagging her tail and whimpered sadly. "I may need to pay her a visit soon, then. Do you have errands? Could I help you with anything at all?" I asked a crestfallen Fletcher, who smiled sadly and shook his head. "It's Sunday. We both ought to go to Church," he chuckled. He was trying to change the subject; I didn't blame him.

I fumbled with my lace collar. "Right. We'll have to get cleaned up, especially Sunny," I muttered.

Small children roamed the streets of North Tanando, stealing colorful scarves right off the mannequins inside various shops and seizing apples right from stocked grocery shelves. I couldn't help but remember the time when Fletcher would do the same thing. One time he even snuck inside my family's mansion to steal pet food for Sunny. "What a joyous lifestyle," I muttered, my cloth shoes squeezing the tips of my feet. Okay, okay. It's not like my life was any better.

"Maybe your father can let us ride Tanando's dragons one day," Fletcher smiled. "They're the last of their kind. I call dibs on the Diamondback!"

"Yellow Jays are way cooler," I scoffed, gazing up at the winged creatures soaring miles above our heads. It was as if they were fantastical illusions that could disappear in an instant. If you thought about it, there was no way such a thing could survive in today's world. "Hey, you sure those are real and aren't some sort of government propaganda?" I asked quietly. Fletcher snickered. "You're starting to sound like those hippies who still believe the earth is flat," he laughed, making my face go red. You know, maybe I wasn't so smart after all.

The Town Church was large, to say the very least. It had wondrous bouquets of eye-catching flowers displayed in every corner of the structure and a beautiful mural painted over an entire wall. The ceiling was made from glass and extended from one side to the other. Countless rows of wooden seats filled the spacious church, giving a sense of togetherness and well-being.

“Looks like we came early,” I whispered, staring at the empty seats in front of us. Fletcher smiled weakly. “Go, Sunny,” he pointed towards the door and smiled. Sunny then exited the church and left Fletcher and I alone. “How’s your father,” he asked, folding his arms and taking a seat. I made a face. “He’s so boring. I wish I had a new father. He’s so… ah. I hate him. I really do,” I scoffed, playing with the cuffs of my jeans. “I just wanna skip stones and paint all day long, but he won’t let me. I have to go to parties and stuff where I usually leave the table and just play with the six-year-olds who often get pencils stuck up their noses.” I shuddered, clearly having post-wartime flashbacks. Fletcher nodded and smiled. “I can totally get what you’re trying to say. Gosh, that must be awful,” he laughed heartily. Yeah. Life was hard.

We prayed, said our goodbyes, and walked on home. Fletcher Barley was a nice person.
