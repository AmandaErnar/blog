I gazed upon the verdant hillcrest stitching itself into the Tanando Mountain's base. The obscure cavities tracing the outline of the range zig-zagged and spiraled gracefully before combining with the noble coastline by the east. The setting sun shone its last bits of light onto our fine city-state, Tanando Landing.
"April, your father wants to have a word with you," my butler, Mr. Bauer, announced as he coughed violently into his elbow. He hadn't taken his medicine today, had he? I cleared my throat politely. "I'll be there in a jiffy," I responded. The truth was, I had no desire to speak with my father. At dinner, he suggested that I marry the son of a certain aristocrat (W.J. Tolley) that I hated with the bottom of my heart, just for a nobler position in society. Like, I hadn’t even met the guy! I had every right to be upset.
Frustrated, I stomped over to my father's study, where he was waiting patiently for me to arrive. The room was spacious and had towering bookshelves overlaying its vintage walls. A prominent chair with a plump, velvet seat settled at one corner of the room, and a grandfather clock in the other. A spectacular gold chandelier hovered elegantly from the room’s astute canopy. In front of my father, a polished table with a green lamp, two tin boxes of cigars, and a heap of unread mail sit serenely.

"April."

My face whitened as soon as I heard my name. My father had long, gray hair and villainous green eyes. He wore a pinstripe suit with the chain of a gold compass dangling from its pocket. His skin, yet wrinkled, had a solemn and insubordinate quality. He sat by his desk with a hazing cigar placed delicately in between his long, bony fingers.
I nervously fiddled with the zipper on my jacket. "Look. Your life is already a mess," he told me, lacing his fingers together. Sighing, he stamped his cigar out on the back of his palm and pursed his lips together.
"I honestly don't want him going anywhere near my daughter," he explained, fits of smoke coming out of his mouth. "He’s a bit of a disgrace to the Tanando aristocracy. Doesn’t even know how to fold his own laundry. A little porkchop, I daresay of that Richard Tolley. And he’s just not right for you! According to his older brother, he spends all day eating pastries baked fresh from the kitchen and sleeping around-- even on Sundays! Oh, did I mention the fact that he isn’t even religious? I could go on and on about how fat little Richard Tolley wouldn’t be a good partner for you. Definitely not that Barley boy, either, so don’t get any ideas. So, April, how about we simply just murder him instead?" He finished.
See, here's the thing with my father: you could never tell if he was joking or not.
I gazed at him quizzically. "Murder?" I laughed.
He shrugged. "Perhaps we could also toss his body into the Tanando river."

I swallowed. "Are you serious?"
"It's easier than it seems. All you gotta do is red tornado and yellow tractor."

I froze. "I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?"
"Red tornado and yellow tractor," he repeated, a self-righteous and calm look on his face.

No, it couldn't be...

"Does it all come back to you now, April?" He asked, bringing more smoke into the smoggy room. "I-" I started, shaking my head. "Does it all make sense?" He asked again, tapping his head as if ridiculing me. Before he could say another word, I instinctively grabbed him by his stupid pinstripe collar and punched him across his smug little face.

"YOU SWINE," I shouted, my voice quivering.

Father smirked. "There's nothing you can do about it," he laughed. "Your friend is gone now. Tell anyone, and they'll hang you as well."
