			<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t possibly understand why I did what I did that fateful day. I&rsquo;d probably rot in hell for the rest of eternity for that.
But for now, I felt nothing at all. Absolutely nothing, not even the slightest bit of regret.
Death really was strange.</p>
<p>A pity, as it was. Life, death, love, hatred; these conceptions were so utterly human, yet so beautiful&hellip;.</p>
<p>As my rotting corpse was set ablaze, I decided to try and revise my answers to the questions I had asked back when my heart still pounded with life.
Were there any gods, or had man fashioned those beings from their unfathomable desire for answers? Were the emperors of the universe merely just selfish fantasies? Had our bittersweet hope blossomed into the mysterious dieties known as gods?</p>
<p>I tried to rewrite the ending to this terrible tale.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I felt my soul blazing with hot lashes of emotion. Then, in a flash of blinding light, I was carried into the afterlife, still mezmerized by my forlorn reverie.</p>
<p><em>Chapter 1, Every End has a Beginning: ALISON</em></p>
<p>I stared at my bright computer screen and bit my lip anxiously, trying to somewhat proofread my client’s obnoxious writing. After a good twenty seconds of fruitlessly studying their insufferable essay on bee preservation, I sighed drowsily and squeezed my eyes shut in misery.</p>
<p>I shut my laptop and ran my cold fingers through my mousy hair.</p>
<p>I hated myself. A miserable college dropout who wrote philosophical poems and books about sociology for a living. Most of my work didn’t even make it out into the public, ha. I also proofread writing, which was my primary source of income, but I liked to think of myself as an author. A good, talented author who always got her point across without a hitch.</p>
<p>I yawned bodaciously as I stood and got up out of my chair. I shambled over to my kitchen and poured myself a glass of water, which tasted like hand soap. I scrunched my nose and flinched at the taste of the disgusting substance. Fucking tap water. I set my cup down into my sink, which was clean for once, and jerked my fridge door open.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much inside, just a plastic jug filled halfway with milk and a slab of cheese. I’d have to grab lunch at the general store again.</p>
<p><strong>something happens here</strong></p>
<p>How did I even end up here, in this shithole of an apartment? I closed my eyes and tried to remember a time when my life once had meaning.</p>
<p>I was nine, writing fiction and doing well in school, bringing home excellent grades and pleasant remarks from my teachers. I barely knew how to tie my own shoes back then. Every afternoon, I’d walk with my friends and head to the candy shop right around the street corner. I had a sound tendency to purchase the tiny blue studs of bubblegum shrouded in gold foil. We’d walk home together with smiles on our faces. There was no Nietzsche, no Schopenhauer to ruin my day.</p>
<p>You could always find my nose stuck in some sort of book or magazine. I wasn’t the most popular person in school as a result, but conformity to others’ standards wasn’t really my thing.</p>
<p>Hitherto, I’d rather slit my own throat than give in to the dogmatic ideology that life was keen and purposeful. It was all pointless, according to me. Every evening I’d divulge myself into the works of Schopenhauer and occupy myself with the hollow feeling of approaching doom for a little while.</p>
<p>Although I raked in lots of money from my desperate clients, I was nothing short of a failure. If only I hadn’t fallen into this pit of despair, with nothing to do and no publisher to divulge my work, I would’ve saved myself from this miserable life.</p>
<p><strong>something happens here</strong></p>
<p>My affirming beliefs and contradictions involving the extinction of humanity made it impossible for me to ever relax. But now that my eyelids were flaccid and heavy, I’d perhaps successfully fall into the pleasant quiescence of sleep.</p>
<p><strong>something happens here</strong></p>
<p>I stomped over to the living room and locked my door. Then, I tore my medicine cabinet open and grabbed a bottle of tiny green pills. I shook it frantically, desperately trying to get lots to pop out of its lid.</p>
<p>I grabbed a fistful of the flimsy nightgown I was wearing and squeezed it tightly. With my other hand, I stuffed a month’s worth of sleeping pills down my throat and instantly collapsed, a few of them escaping their fate of being swallowed and rattling with freedom as they fell to the floor. My eyes then fluttered shut, leaving my medicine cabinet door open and empty pill bottle left cold on the counter.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until I awoke from my slumber to a lady dressed in white standing there, our faces only inches apart. Was I in heaven? No. God wasn’t real, of course. “A human,” the lady mumbled. I exhaled deeply and stared into her captivatingly red eyes.</p>
<p>“Christ,” I mouthed. Her eyelashes were abnormally long and laced with white, and her hair was the color of ash. Her gleaming eyes contrasted against her soft appearance and her silhouette was slender and fragile. It was as if she were a snowflake, vanishing to the touch.</p>
<p>I studied my surroundings and came to the conclusion that I was probably dreaming… those sleeping pills really must’ve done it for me. I lifted my hand off the ground and felt a grainy substance pass through its gaps… sand. I attempted to drive myself backward, away from the bizarre woman, but something hard behind me wasn’t letting that happen. I gaped and turned around to find a rock towering over my body, rugged and black.</p>
<p>It then came to me that this wasn’t a dream or hallucination of any sort. Everything around here felt so…  real. Every single feature of the realm I was in provided me with a genuine and loving comfort. The woman and I were sitting by some kind of dreamland seashore. Palm trees gently swayed in the distance, ashen waves crashed violently against the vast pillars of rock by the shore, seagulls squawked freely in the distance with flailing fish fitted in between their claws, and tufts of clouds floated dreamily in the milky blue sky. Where was I, exactly?</p>
<p>“Welcome to Hell,” the lady stammered (angel beats reference). Gushes of gentle wind brushed up against my skin and sent a chill down my spine. Her face seemed cold and distant as if something withered and shriveled up inside her. She looked old and tired, yet her face sparkled with youth.</p>
<p>I looked around and shook my head. “This doesn’t look like Hell,” I told her. Everything around here had its own sort of beauty. This land felt free and youthful. If anything, this was everything I ever wanted.</p>
<p>The lady smiled wistfully and looked down at the sandy floor, her flaky eyelashes fluttering blissfully. “There’s nothing to do here,” she told me, “miles and miles of nothing.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty though,” I chuckled with content, peering at the crashing waves behind her with content. She stared at our surroundings and shrugged. “I guess so,” she sighed, her voice hollow.</p>
