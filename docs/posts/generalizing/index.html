			<p>The world&rsquo;s smartest folks know how to do this thing really well: generalizing different words of wisdom. Generalizing big ideas is very simple! Let me give you an example. In biology class, students learn about food webs and food chains. They also learn about the energy transfer and how it decreases by 10% at each step of the food pyramid due to more energy being spent, and the exponential decrease in energy being consumed. A good student would study the details and facts about organisms consuming things at each trophic level. However, an <em>excellent</em> student would only focus on grasping the concept that energy flows from one organism to the other. Yes, you may need to learn about detailed things in order to pass and exam or test, but in order to fully understand a particular topic, one must generalize their ideas.</p>
